Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Delusional Disorder (DD) are psychological disorders that are both characterized by faulty beliefs about reality which cause a considerable degree of distress and behavioral problems. Indeed, research over the past nine years has established that what is problematic for the person with OCD and DD is not what actually occurs, but what they imagine to be there. In particular, a tendency to arrive at false beliefs about reality appears strongly related to level of insight into our own reasoning. In particular, a critical mass of studies has shown that failures in introspection are 1) profound, 2) at the root of what appears to be insight, and 3) measurable in an experimental reasoning task (Johansson et al, 2005). Over the next four years, 140 adult patients will participate in a study to measure introspective ability and insight into their own reasoning (OCD, DD and Anxiety Disorder). An additional eighty participants from the general population will be tested for comparison purposes. After baseline assessment on questionnaire, clinical and experimental measures, those with OCD will be retested after 24 weeks of receiving specialized cognitive-behavior therapy. The key hypothesis is that those with OCD and Delusional Disorder will show systematic failures in introspection which leads to obsessional doubt and false beliefs about reality. It is also expected that improvements in insight and introspective ability will be associated with successful treatment outcome. The research program will provide crucial new information on reasoning and imaginative processes characterizing these debilitating psychological disorders, and assist in the development of much needed new treatment strategies.
