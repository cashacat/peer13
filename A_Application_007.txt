Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a highly disabling psychiatric illness, characterized by obsessional thoughts that cause patients to perform time-consuming and distressing compulsive rituals. Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is a first-line psychological treatment of choice, which requires patients to face their fears by being exposed to feared stimuli. ERP has been shown to reduce symptoms among those who comply with treatment. However, there is still a significant portion of patients that do not improve, especially those who firmly believe their obsessions are realistic and reasonable (i.e. OCD with Overvalued Ideation). Also, a large proportion of patients refuse the treatment or drop out during treatment due to the distress provoked by ERP. That leaves at most 3-4 out of 10 people with OCD who benefit from ERP, and even then, residual symptoms often remain, or symptoms eventually reappear after treatment. One evidence-based approach to the treatment of OCD, termed inference-based cognitive therapy (IBCT) has been shown to be as effective as ERP with the potential to overcome the limitations of ERP. Since IBCT is a cognitive approach, the treatment does not require exposure to feared stimuli and likely more tolerable for patients with OCD. Also, there is evidence that IBCT is more effective than ERP for those with overvalued ideation, since it directly targets the distorted reasoning that is responsible for the intensity and persistence of the obsession. The current study aims to directly compare ERP with this promising evidence-based cognitive therapy, which is expected to be significantly more effective for those with overvalued ideation, as well as significantly more tolerable with lower rates of treatment refusal, drop-out and higher treatment satisfaction. The project is designed to maximize potential beneficial health outcomes and offer a new evidence-based treatment option for the large proportion of patients unable to benefit from ERP.
