Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often experience frequent exacerbations which are of major importance since they have a long-lasting adverse influence on health status. COPD exacerbations are associated with increased lung inflammation that may contribute to other health problems such as muscle weakness, cognitive impairment, depression, stroke, and heart conditions. Statins are effective medications that have been shown to significantly reduce heart attacks and strokes and they also have anti-inflammatory effects. Observational studies suggest statins can reduce COPD exacerbations, but this has not been studied in a clinical trial. The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients treated with a statin medication have fewer exacerbations of COPD in comparison to patients who receive placebo therapy.
