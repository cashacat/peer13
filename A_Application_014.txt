The Canadian Respiratory Research Network (CRRN) will create an enduring national network of researchers and platforms to enable innovative, collaborative, respiratory health research. The goals are to integrate research efforts to produce findings that improve understanding of the origins and progression of the two most common chronic airway diseases in Canada, asthma and COPD. Our platforms will be a springboard for future networked projects that will eventually focus on other lung diseases, some that present in neonates and infants. Ultimately these efforts will significantly improve prevention, management and care of airway disease and will foster public health and health services innovations to improve respiratory health across Canada.
