The Canadian Airway Research Network (CARN) will create an enduring national patient-oriented research network of investigators, patients, stakeholders and research platforms to enable innovative, collaborative, respiratory health research. The goals are to integrate research efforts to produce findings that improve understanding of the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of common chronic airway diseases in Canada; including asthma, COPD, lung cancer, cystic fibrosis and broncho-pulmonary dysplasia. Ultimately these efforts will significantly improve prevention, management and care of chronic airway diseases and will foster public health and health services innovations to improve respiratory health across Canada.
