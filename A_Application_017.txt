The overall goal of the program of research described in this application will be to provide a description of the prevalence and the burden of un-diagnosed asthma and COPD in Canadian communities. The research will focus on testing new diagnostic and treatment strategies meant to correct system-wide problems associated with under-diagnosis and management of these 2 diseases. We will test whether earlier diagnosis of previously un-diagnosed asthma and COPD, identified through case-finding, can lead to better treatment and better health outcomes for patients who suffer from these two common chronic diseases. Ultimately these studies will improve the respiratory health of Canadians.
