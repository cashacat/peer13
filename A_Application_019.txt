Celiac disease (CD) is a complex intestinal inflammatory disorder induced by dietary gluten, which development is controlled by a combination of environmental and genetic risk factors. CD is highly prevalent in North America with around 1% of the Canadian population affected by the disease. The classical pathological changes of CD in the small bowel encompass an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes, the presence of autoantibodies, and a destruction of the lining of the small intestine (called villous atrophy). The only effective treatment currently available for CD is a lifelong gluten free diet (GFD), yet persistent symptoms and intestinal tissue damage are commonplace among celiac patients that adhere to a GFD. Thus, there is an urgent need for non-dietary therapies that improve patient health and alleviate the social and personal constraints associated with following a GFD. The development of new therapies has however proven challenging because of our incomplete understanding of the mechanisms underlying CD pathogenesis (particularly the factors leading to villous atrophy) and the lack of a suitable mouse model of CD. We have recently developed a series of humanized mice that recapitulate all the main features observed in CD patients, including the development of villous atrophy in response to gluten ingestion. These newly developed mouse models are likely to revolutionize research in CD by allowing to study the complex innate and adaptive immune mechanisms leading to villous atrophy and to test novel therapies. Here, we propose to use a systems biology approach that will capitalize on the use of these innovative mouse models together with human samples to identify genes and pathways that contribute to the development of villous atrophy in active CD patients. In addition, our work may lead to the validation of a long-awaited physiopathologically relevant murine model of CD that is indispensable to implement novel therapeutic strategies.
