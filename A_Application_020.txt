Celiac Disease (CD) is a complex intestinal inflammatory disorder induced by dietary gluten, which development is controlled by a combination of environmental and genetic risk factors. CD is highly prevalent in North America with around 1% of the Canadian population affected by the disease. The only effective treatment currently available for CD is a lifelong gluten free diet (GFD), yet persistent symptoms and intestinal tissue damage are commonplace among celiac patients that adhere to a GFD. Thus, there is an urgent need for non-dietary therapies that improve patient health and alleviate the social and personal constraints associated with following a GFD. The development of new therapies has however proven challenging because of our incomplete understanding of the mechanisms underlying CD pathogenesis. It is well recognized that T lymphocytes play a central role in CD by causing tissue destruction, however, B lymphocytes - specialized cells involved in the secretion of antibodies and autoantibodies - are also likely very important. Indeed, autoantibodies against the enzyme tissue transglutaminase are produced in CD and their titers have been shown to correlate with intestinal damage. Here we propose to study the contribution of intestinal B cell responses to the pathogenesis of CD and to evaluate in vivo the biological role of autoantibodies in a mouse model of CD that recapitulates all the main features observed in CD patients. We will capitalize on the use of our unique mouse model together with human serum samples to decipher the contribution of B cells to CD immunopathogenesis and to characterize the impact of autoantibodies on the development and/or exacerbation of the disease. In addition of a considerable gain of knowledge on the immunopathogenesis of CD, our work may lead to the identification of novel targets that might guide novel therapeutic strategies.
